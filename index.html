                        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>I am a recent grad who is interested in Data Science and wants to use technology and data to make the world a better place. While I love physics, I have also learned that solving puzzles in data science is incredibly rewarding and powerful. I hope to continue working in the data science field in a way that allows me to help make people's lives better.</p>

                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>I have a bachelor's degree in phyiscs from the University of California - Davis and have been doing research in physics for the past couple years.  Currently I am conducting research in cosmology studying galaxy cluster mergers to understand the properties of dark matter. The work I do is a lot of fun and has helped me develop skills in researching, data analysis, and writing professional documents. My group just submitted a paper for publishing that I am second author on. Drop me a line if you have any questions about it. I'm always happy to talk about my work!</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>I taught myself Python during my first year of college in preparation for a C language programming course that I had to take later. Since then I have used Python almost daily to conduct research in the physics department and do a few side projects along the way. In doing so, I have learned to use multiple Python packages, such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. I also have a little experience with C/C++, SQL, HTML/CSS, and the Google Cloud Vision API. I am currently focusing on machine learning techniques and trying out a few smaller projects to get comfortable with the ins and outs of the relevant packages.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>I financed my degree with many part-time jobs starting back in high school. I've worked at a ski resort as a ski instructor, a grocery store as a stocker/janitor, a cafeteria as a server, a library as a desk supervisor, and physics laboratory as a research assistant in the past few years. From these places I've learned how to work in a team, lead projects, create a positive work environment, and be determined enough to finish multi-year-long projects.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <div>
                            <p>I love hiking, running, and anything that involves being outside with people. I hope to travel all around the world and meet new, exciting people and experience different cultures. I also love reading and cooking. I'm currently trying to teach myself to cook Indian food and reading "Around India in 80 Trains" as preparation for my summer trip to India. I'm teaching myself Spanish as well because I hope to travel/work/live in Latin America in the future. </p>

                        <div class="space-20"></div>
                        <p>This has been the largest project I've worked on by far. I picked up this project in 2016 after the last person working on it left our research group because they transfered schools. Since then the project has grown in magnitude and scope quite a bit. I am the principle researcher and have written all but a very small portion of the code. The physics we are researching in this project is the dynamics of merging galaxy clusters. From studying this we hope to learn about the properties of dark matter on a large scale. My responsibilities include retrieving data, researching relevant cosmological phenomena, giving input on project direction, cleaning/processing data, creating visualizations to show our results, and explaining our process and conclusions in our paper. You can view our  <a href="AnalogPaper.pdf">paper</a> or check out my  <a href="https://github.com/B-Cornell/CSS_Scripts">Github repository</a> for this project.</p>

                        <h3 class="blue-color">High Marks at HackDavis</h3>
                        <div class="space-20"></div>
                        <p>I participated in the HackDavis 2018 as part of a team of four that created the "High Marks" web applet. In 24 hours, we learned how to used the Google Cloud Vision API, implemented it as a web applet, deployed a semi-useable product, and won a cup stacking competition while having a lot of fun! Our team decided to create a web applet that would use a picture of text, such as notes for a class or an academic article, and organize the text by highlighted color. This would allow the user to highlight key terms, key ideas, and confusing sections in different colors, and take a picture of it that the applet would then organize to make it easy to go back over later. We never were able to finish a final product, but we were able to get the applet running on one of our machines within the last hour of the competition and demoed our product to judges in the end. I consider it a pretty big success since nobody on our team had ever deployed an applet, used the Google Cloud API, or been to a hackathon before. We have the code in our <a href="https://github.com/B-Cornell/Filter-Highlights">Github repository</a> and our project description on the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/high-marks">Devpost website</a>.</p>

                        <div class="space-20"></div>
                        <p>Right now I am finishing up the last couple details on my Merging Galaxy Clusters paper. After I finish this I will be using the same simulation we took data from to conduct further studies on different aspects of the data. Most likely I'll be focusing on the periods of merger events. I will also be mentoring a new student who is joining our group for the summer and will be working on data from the same simulation I've been working on the past couple years.</p>
